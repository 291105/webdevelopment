        <h1>ORIGIN OF THE WORD <q>COCKTAIL</q></h1>
        <p>
            There is debate about when the term was first used. According the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/1256/the-surprising-history-of-the-cocktail.html">The London Telegraph</a>,
            the word is first found in print in a March 20, 1798 satirical newspaper article about what must
            have been a hell of a party. Of particular note, was the account of drinks
            imbibed by William Pitt (the younger) which included <q>L&rsquo; huile de Venus,</q> <q>parfait amour,</q>
            and <q> &lsquo;  cock-tail (vulgarly called ginger.) &rsquo; </q> Some challenge whether <q>cocktail</q>
            in this article truly referred to an alcoholic drink, or something else.
        </p>

        <p>
            Others point to an April 28, 1803 article from The Farmer&rsquo;s Cabinet in Vermont,
            where to drink a cocktail was claimed to be <q>excellent for the head.</q>
        </p>

        <p id="guarantee">
            Regardless, certainly by 1806, the word was being used with its current meaning. In the May 13th edition of the newspaper,
            Balance and Columbian Repository, the editor defined a cocktail as:
            <a href="http://www.chowhound.com/food-news/54845/whats-the-origin-of-the-word-cocktail/"><q>a stimulating liquor composed of spirits of any kind &#8209; sugar, water, and bitters.</q></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            During the early 17th century, an animal, particularly a horse, with a docked tail, was said to have a <q>cock tail.</q>
            By the 19th century, unlike other horses, thoroughbreds did not have docked tails, so when a regular
            horse was entered into a race, its cock tail was noted &#8209; and became a term synonymous with an
            adulterated horse. Since horse racing and liquor go together like peaches and cream, this
            theory holds that the word <q>cock tail</q> was soon used to mean an adulterated spirit.
        </p>

        <p>
            A second theory holds that the name is derived from the term <q>cock tailings,</q>
            the result of the practice of tavern owners combining the dregs (tailings) of nearly empty barrels
            together into a single elixir that was sold at bargain prices.
            This only makes sense when you know that the spigot of a barrel was
            sometimes referred to as a <q>cock.</q>
